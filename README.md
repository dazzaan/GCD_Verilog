# GCD_Verilog
 subtraction algorithm works:

Start with two numbers:
 Let's say we have two integers a and b for which we want to find the GCD.
Subtract the smaller number from the larger number: We subtract the smaller of the two numbers from the larger one. This step is repeated until both numbers become equal.
Repeat until both numbers are equal: After each subtraction, we update the larger number to be the absolute difference between the two numbers.
GCD is the remaining number: Once both numbers become equal, the remaining number is the GCD of the original two numbers.
